# brailleorch
A program written in python for conversion between musicxml and braille music format

This software is currently only a plan, and the framework have not been updated since May 24, 2018, due to a change of license and a reserve for different use. For the latest version of the framework, please visit [this link](#http://www.brailleorch.org/en/framework) on my project website.
