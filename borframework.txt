========================================

Preliminary Materials

1. Purpose
This is a detailed framework of BrailleOrch, braille music transcription software for advanced publishing requirements. The final software will convert Musicxml files, or via a separate plugin, Sibelius files, into our extended Braille Music Markup Language (BMML) format (originally created and copyrighted by Veia Progetti s.r.l. [http://www.veia.it], Italy, as free software. See copyright information in the BMML package for details), which can be flexibly edited and modified, to fulfill most of the requirements of braille music publishment.

Since this software is free, and under GPL and Veia free software licenses, anyone who are willing to help us can join in to develop it. We welcome people around the world to do anything making convenience to braille music production for blind musicians.

----------------------------------------

2. Requirements
An experienced Python and XML knowledge is required for developing this software. A basic Github knowledge is required for committing changes. Knowledge of music, musicxml, braille and/or braille music is recommended, which will largely enhance the efficiency and quality of development. Sibelius Manuscript Language is required if anyone who wants to make a BrailleOrch export plugin for Sibelius. Some items in Sibelius can't be correctly exported into musicxml via its internal export function and/or Dolet For Sibelius plugin.

The software will run under any Microsoft Windows systems, from Windows 2000/XP to Windows 10, both 32 and 64 bits. A screen reader such as NVDA is required for announcing unicode braille objects. Music publishers and sighted braille transcribers are not asked for this option.

----------------------------------------

3. About BrailleOrch Format
BrailleOrch (.bor) format is a compressed file. It contains original musicxml (if transcribed from musicxml) and bmml sources, and additional debugging information such as error records. When the final editing and correction has been finished, the musicxml source and most debugging information can be removed to save file size. People can still edit and reformat braille output, though. See Make final document in File Menu.

----------------------------------------

4. About This Framework
This comprehensive document will describe all menus and functions of BrailleOrch. People who wants to develop/enhance the software must read it carefully. It will, however, not discuss the development of current BMML and Musicxml to braille transcription issues. These will be discussed either in a separate article, or in a future mailinglist or forum. Only critical requirement of changes needed to be done are shown.

----------------------------------------

5. Working Progress
Since this is an extensive project for a highly sophisticated software, we have to divide the development session into several phases.

The first phase is to build up a general GUI, containing basic menus and functions. Use original BMML source to define and enhance braille music transcription. Missing signs in BMML DTD must be added. Basic functions in Page setup, Score/Part/Text/Lyrics/Chords/Metronome management and Transcription options dialogs should be done. Bar-over-bar and line-over-line formats are firstly considered. The result braille music score can represent at least 95% information of print version. The score can be manually edited, but not reformatted and retagged automatically, since this requires deeper research of BMML and further development of the software. The user-edited strings are gray-colored, and simply marked as "other" in BMML, and can be tagged in future versions of the software.

The second phase is to enhance transcription quality. Items in Musicxml 3.0 or later should be added, and the formatting function must be more flexible. Add section-by-section format. Enhance translation table to add support to Chinese Mandarin braille (Cantonese and Taiwanese Chinese braille have already been done in Liblouis).

The third phase is to enhance the reformatting function. The software can recognize most user-entered strings as music signs, texts etc, and can correctly break lines when reformatted.

The fourth phase is to develop a Sibelius plug-in, directly exporting .bor files from Sibelius. Musicxml exported from Sibelius has some information missing, because there are special user items. We can use Manuscript Language to make the braille version more close to the original score. Unspecified items can also be exported and tagged for manual editing. BMML exported from this plugin is not correctly formatted, so this tool has to be delayed to the time BrailleOrch is powerful and flexible enough.

The last phase is to develop the braille music composing function. Since the software can already recognize common braille music signs entered, the main focus is on advanced signs, creating parts and groups, writing chord symbols, handling visual appearance, Midi functions etc.

========================================

Chapter 1: Menu Overview
This chapter describes all menus and submenus. It gives us a brief view of the major functions of BrailleOrch.

1.1 File Menu
New
To create a new BMML document. This will not be considered currently, unless we decide to develop braille music composing side. Braille Music Editor 2 from Veia Progetti can do a intermediate level work of it, and blind musicians can now use ABC, Lilypond and Sibelius to produce print music scores. So our main goal is to develop a transcription software.

Open
Open a BMML file (.bmml), both original Veia version and our extended new version. Our new version contains more information and functions, so for portability purpose, it will be a compressed xml file with the extension .bor. Another kind of unprocessed .bor file can also be opened, see Import.

Open recent
A list of recent created/opened files. Number of files can be set or cleared in Options dialog.

Save
Save the current BMML file in either BMML or Bor format. The BMML format is not an old version of BMML, but an uncompressed Bor file. This can be used for researching the format to help developers get familiar with BMML.

Save As
Save the file using a different name or to a different location, in either BMML or Bor format.

Versioning (submenu)
Save Version
open Version
Versioning function is for further comparison of the score. The version files will be saved using .bor format, with a time/date stamp after the extension. E.G., foo.bor~01312016.
Saving an earlier version will bring up a dialog, asking whether you want to save a new version or overwrite the current non-version file.

Set copy protection
This is a special function for protecting music pubisher's copyright. After they convert their scores into musicxml and import into BrailleOrch, they can immediately set this option. The file can still be edited, reformatted and embossed, but can't be exported into musicxml for back-translation. The file is also encrypted, so it also can't be saved as bmml format. Any debugging process upon the xml source and bmml score can, however, be done using the internal debugging interface.
Be careful to use this function, since it's not reversable. We should provide two times of verification dialog for this. Another possibility is, we can toggle this item visible and invisible in the "Option" dialog, to prevent accidental operation by common users.

Make final document
Be careful to use it like Set copy protection. This will remove musicxml source and most debugging information from the file. So don't use it before the final correction of braille music is done, especially when there are errors. As I said before, the metadata will be protected using Set copy protection function, so the protected musicxml source can't be extracted. So don't worry about the source. After making the final document, people can still edit and reformat braille music score, but can't debug and make enhancement of the software.

Close
Close All
Close the current working document(s).

Import
Import Musicxml files, from version 1.0 to the latest version, both compressed (.mxl) and uncompressed (.xml). The transcription process will begin, see Transcription dialog for details.
Import ASCII/unicode braille file, making ASCII2Unicode or vice versa conversion according to chosen braille table. This will not automatically generate a bmml format, but just storing and converting original data. This way, the .bor file is just a compressed version of original source. When we decide to develop braille music composing side, this situation will be changed.
Importing MIDI file will also be considered in the future.

Export
Export MIDI and Musicxml formats. This will be considered later.
Export to unicode or ASCII braille. This is the current function. When exporting to ASCII, an option dialog will appear for choosing a braille table. Different country uses different braille mapping table.

Page setup
Settings for braille pages.
In this dialog:
Lines per page: line amount spin editbox, default 25
Cells per page: Cell amount spin editbox, default 32
Adding form feeds: checkbox for inserting form feeds. Default checked
Print page numbers: braille printing page numbers. Default checked
Print page number position: listbox, topleft, topright, bottomleft and bottomright. Default topleft
Braille page numbers: braille braille page numbers. Default checked
Braille page number position: listbox, topleft, topright, bottomleft and bottomright. Default topright
When these two positions get conflicted, a warning message will appear, asking the user to adjust the position correctly.
Show page turn: checkbox, visible when Print page numbers is checked. Page turn includes dots 5 2-5 with (or without) new page number.
Page turn format: listbox. Choices are: within music, above music, within music without page number.

Emboss
Emboss braille music scores using installed braille embosser drivers.

Exit
Quit the software.

----------------------------------------

1.2 Edit Menu

However, there's an checkbox to switch on "searching for texts", which switches of unicode braille input (fsd for d-ots 123, jkl for 456), and directly search within the xml sources for standard texts, including dynamics and any text-based values. The result will bring the cursor to correct braille location.

----------------------------------------

1.3 View Menu
The common view menu for sighted users. It includes simple view options such as zooming, visibility of toolbar, and braille reading modes etc.
Braille reading mode will give us options to choose white-screen-black-dots or black-screen-white/blue/green-dots.

----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

1.5 Transcription Menu
This menu handles various transcription functions.

Transcribe
This is a manual action of transcription. If the user wants to start from fresh beginning to undo all previous modification, or after debugging problematic musicxml file, this will start a new transcription session. Transcription dialog will or will not appear according to setting in the dialog or Options dialog.

Bar-over-bar (default)
Line-over-line
Section-by-section
These 3 options will change the current format of score. The formatting will be done according to settings in Options dialog. We highly recommend people to set their preferred format as default in the Options dialog, to reduce any messy formatting problems.
All detailed options for these formats can be found and will be discussed in the Options Dialog section.
For single-staff instrument solo, the above will be unavailable, and settings for single-line format will be applied. See corresponding settings in Options dialog for details.

Reformat
Reformat the braille score after manual editing and correction. Formatting layout will follow rules set in Score/Part/Text/Lyrics/Chords/Metronome, Options and Page setup dialogs. Options changed after transcription process can also be applied.

Debugging mode
A special mode used for checking errors and enhancing the software. See Debugging Mode for details.

Output interval direction description
A dialog appears, letting you to view the description. There are 2 kinds of description:
1. When all intervals are up/down, it will let you choose from two methods of descriptions:
a. Literary: All intervals are read upwards/downwards;
2. Notation: a C with second interval sign, space, two dots 3-5's, space, two notes with in-accord, either C-D or C-B.
2. When different intervals are used, it will show as:
All intervals are read upwards/downwards, except blah blah, which is/are read downwards/upwards.

Output part list
See this item in Part management dialog for details.

Extract parts
Extract parts for players/singers. A dialog appears, letting you check part(s) to extract. New .bor documents with only bmml sources for individual parts will be created. You can change the order of parts, or choose whether to extract parts as individual files or just one file shwing parts one by one. If "combin individual parts" is checked, the result file will generate a full score containing selected parts (this is useful for publishing choral scores containing vocal parts only).

Combine parts to score
A reversed operation of part extraction. A dialog appears, letting you add files and adjust their order. But the files must be the whole parts of the same piece, otherwise BrailleOrch will refuse to go ahead. BrailleOrch will first check the coincidence of time and measure among all parts, and shows a warning message telling which file(s) are unmatched. BrailleOrch will check coincidence according to the topmost file.

----------------------------------------

1.6 Braille Music Menu
This menu gives us several functions of editing and correcting braille music score. Some are very sophisticated functions.
This menu will be modified and extended when we decide to develop braille music composing function.

Input (submenu)
Insert notes (n)
Enter notes/rests/voices, generally all music-related signs.
Insert texts (x)
Enter texts using standard input method. Untranslated unicode texts such as Chinese will be accepted, and can be edited later. All text-related adjustment can be done in Text management dialog.
Insert key signature (k)
Insert time signature (t)
These two use braille input.
Insert chord names and figured bass (c)
Braille input of chord and figure symbols.
Insert title page information (i)
Insert title info at top of system. See Score management dialog for details.
There's a checkbox for inserting title info on a blank page. If checked, a blank page will be created.
Insert footnotes (o)
Add a line of dots 3-5's plus footnotes.
Insert division signs (v)
Centered 12 division characters. Choose from dots 3-5 and dots 5.
Insert new print page (shift+p)
Insert new braille page (shift+b)
These are for modification and/or reformatting, or when no print pages are available in musicxml 1.0. Also useful when developing braille music composing. Print page will be inserted at the beginning of the measure, while braille page will be inserted at the beginning of the current braille line.
Set current measure (m)
Set number of current measure, overriding measure numbers in Musicxml. The consequent measure numbers will be changed accordingly, until Musicxml specifies a new sequence of measure number (e.g.,, starting a new movement from measure 1).
Set current braille page (b)
Set current braille page number. The extra choices for numbering are arabic, roman, lower-celled and (for title pages) none.
Set current print page (p)
Set current print page number, overriding Musicxml's settings. The extra choices are arabic, roman and none.

Other tags and properties can be marked using context menu directly on braille objects. Transcribers can also edit the score without using the above insert and context functions, but the result input will be marked as "other" in BMML, and can't be automatically reformatted correctly. They should be manually formatted.

Score management
A tool for managing various items such as page/measure numbering, movement divisions etc for the whole score or selected block. See corresponding chapter for details.

Part management
A very powerful tool for managing part names and grouping properties in the score. See corresponding chapter for details.

Text management
A very powerful tool for managing various text items in the score. See corresponding chapter for details.

Lyrics management
A tool for managing lyrics in the score. See corresponding chapter for details.

Chords management
(to do it later)
A tool for modifying chord symbols.

Metronome management
A tool to manage metronome marks in the score. See corresponding chapter for details.

----------------------------------------

1.7 Playback Menu
Play/stop (ctrl+l)
Play current measure (shift+l)
Play current part (ctrl+;)
Play current voice (shift+;)
Play metronome (default unchecked)

Choose instruments
List out all parts and their midi instruments. Assign button will bring up a dialog containing a 128-line list of GM instruments. By default, BrailleOrch will assign correct instruments according to settings in Musicxml.
BrailleOrch should be able to use multiple instances of GM modules to handle more than 16 parts.

Play sounds when navigating
Whether to play MIDI sounds during cursor navigation. Default: checked.

Playback device
Choose from available sound devices for Midi playback.

----------------------------------------

========================================

Chapter 2: Deeper View Of Transcription Function
This is the core of the software, so please be careful to read it. For knowledge of braille music, please consult New International Manual Of Braille Music Notation (SBS, 1996) <https://www.rnib.org.uk/sites/default/files/New%20International%20Manual.pdf> and Music Braille Code 1997 (BANA) <https://www.loc.gov/nls/music/music%20braille%20code.pdf>. The latter contains more information about different formats used in braille music, and also some extra signs.

The software will treat score with only one part with one staff as single-line format.  It will automatically treat score with only one part with two to four staves as piano (or organ, chosen by the user) format. It will treat score with one single-line part above one multi-stave part as solo with keyboard accompaniment part, and add dots 5 3-4-5 before the single-line part.

2.1 Transcription dialog
Note: All dialogs in this software have "ok" and "cancel" buttons.

When importing a Musicxml file, the software brings up a dialog, giving the users options for adjusting transcription appearance. It can be turned off by checking Don't show this dialog again at the bottom of the dialog, or via Options dialog. The last settings will be stored, and users can override these options in Options dialog. The Transcription dialog also contains lots of buttons to bring up corresponding options in that dialog.

Braille score format
Radio buttons: bar-over-bar, line-over-line and section-by-section. Default is bar-over-bar.
When one format is chosen, the corresponding option button will be shown, bringing user to corresponding items in Options dialog.

Page setup
Brings up Page setup dialog in File menu.

Score/Part/Text/Lyrics/Chords/metronome management
Bring up corresponding dialogs which are also available in Braille Music menu.

Transcription settings
Bring up Transcription settings in Options dialog.

Translation table
Used for text translation. This can also be seen in Options and Score/Part/Text/Lyrics/Chords management dialogs.

Don't show this dialog
Disable this dialog, using options previously set.

----------------------------------------

2.2 Score Management Dialog
Description of the score
This is a read-only text box, showing summary of the score. Available items are: general header, individual headers (headers with their starting print/braille pages), number of print/braille pages, number of measures, page format, score format (single-line, bar-over-bar, line-over-line, section-by-section).

Running header: some countries have running headers at the top of page. A general header can be set here. Some books use different header on different piece. This can be done by specifying individual headers using context menu within the score, and will override the general header.

Title/Subtitle/Composer/Lyricist/Copyright/Other
These edit boxes will be automatically filled if they can be retrieved from Musicxml source. Otherwise the user can enter them here, and the braille will be automatically generated and formatted. User can also insert them form Insert title page information dialog under Input submenu of Braille Music menu. If entered as braille manually, they can also be tagged later using context menu. The result braille can be copied/cut/pasted freely on the page.

Table of contents dialog
This can be written in the braille window, but can also be done here. The difference is, the one set here can function like TOC items in MS Word, bringing the user to corresponding location.
TOC title: Enter normal text, and the software can handle it correctly.
The TOC format is title plus dashes or dots (dot 3 or 5) plus page number. There are 2 columns, one for title, one for braille pages. Indentation is automatic.
Division patterns
Radio button: dashes (dots 3-6), dot 3 and dot 5.
Indentation: edit box. Default, by 2 cells

Context menu for the above items should add "Translation table".

Note: 1. Current untranslatabre texts such as Chinese characters can be manually translated via Text management dialog in context menu.
2. If items in this dialog are removed completely, and no user-entered info are on title and TOC pages, the blank pages will always be removed automatically. Division signs will be removed even they are not deleted here.

----------------------------------------

2.3 Part Management Dialog
Some Musicxml files have long part/abbreviation names, some have missing part/abbrev names, and some have group names for group of staves. These are not able to be transcribed correctly. Here's a powerful tool for solving this problem.
Part names and abbreviations will be automatically transcribed into braille, except Chinese, which can be edited in the Braille parts list table.
All line breaks in the Musicxml part field will be shown as \n, and discarded in braille version. Such kind of part names must be manually edited.

Print part list
List all original items in <score-partlist> of Musicxml.
Items in this extensive table view can be navigated using arrow keys, selected using shift+arrow, edited by pressing F2, and deleted using Del key. Its format is managed as follows:
group name, group abbreviation, part ID, part name, and part abbreviation.
Any item will be left empty when no one is found.
Staves in a group will display group name and abbrev on all staves.
When a multi-stave part is available, number or letter sequences will be added after the abbreviation names. Default is number.

Context menu items
Undo/Redo
Common undo/redo function.
Combine these staves
Piano/harp/organ parts in some orchestral scores are not grouped correctly. Select this to make selected staves into group.
Treat as piano
Change current group into piano format, thus adding hand signs before each staff. You can delete part names not belonging to the first staff.
Treat as organ
The same as piano, but treat the 3rd staff as organ pedal.
Treat as multi-stave parts
Some divisi parts have only two staves, and will be ocassionally transcribed as piano parts. Use this to turn them into common multi-stave parts.
Use group name
select if the part names in a group are missing or just arabic or roman numbers. E.g., some scores mark "Horns in F" as group name, and "I II" "III IV" as part names, no abbreviations or abbreviations are the same as part names. But such modified abbreviation names must still be edited for braille use.
Use letter sequences for multi-stave part
Select if you want to use letters for current multi-stave part, e.g., vln1a, where numbers have already been used.

Braille part list
This table is used for editing braille which can't be correctly transcribed. Braille input will be activated by pressing F2.

These two tables are linked, so scrolling one of them will also make the other scroll.

Interval direction
Radio button up/down to control interval and voice reading direction of current selected part(s). Default is down for all parts in score without piano-property parts.

All up
All down
All up except piano
All down except piano
This 4 buttons will make interval direction changes globaly. Piano applies only to parts with piano property, including organ and harp parts.

----------------------------------------

2.4 Text Management Dialog
A comprehensive dialog like Part management dialog. It lists out all texts items in the score. For dialog opened this way, only words, DoletSibelius unrecognized system texts and rehearsal marks are listed. When opened using context menu, items such as title page and TOC info can be displayed.

Text list
A same table as part list, but with different layout:
measure, beat, part, voice, text, braille
The list is sorted timewisely by default. Blank spaces at the beginning/end of text block will be automatically removed, and can be manually entered in braille if needed.
One difference is, the Del key will remove the text from the score. So please use F2 to clear and re-edit it.

Context menu
Undo/Redo
Common undo/redo function.
Translation table
Choose one for current text. When using word signs, all uppercase will be ignored.
Mark as dynamic
Some special dynamic markings such as "sffzp" are not treated as dynamic in notation programs. This will tag the current text as dynamic mark.
Mark as metronome mark
This will change the property into metronome mark. Sometimes, special metronome marks are not assigned correctly in Musicxml. BMML must be re-designed to accept user-defined texts as metronome marks.
Put word signs before every word
Mark as rehearsal mark
Rehearsal mark will be parenthesized, either within or above system.
Long text blocks
Use parenthesis
These are 3 different functions. The first adds dots 3-4-5 before every word in the text block; the second puts dots 3-4-5 around the whole block, and makes a space before (except fore after part name, hand sign, sign for begin of repetition and clef sign) and after (except for end of line) the block; and the last adds parenthesis to the block, with a space before (except for the same condition) and after (except for the same condition) it.
Chinese texts
This will add Chinese music parenthesis (dots 5-6 3-6 and dots 3-6 2-3) around the text. Once the Chinese translation is available, this option will be removed.
Treat as texts outside music
Treat as texts inside music
Treat as non-music texts
These 3 choices will move current text item outside or inside the score. When outside the music, it will be normal text without word signs, placed on top of the staff it belongs to. You can still add parenthesis around it. Non-music texts are some long text blocks such as title or performace instructions (somemusicmxl files have title information attached to score, or marked as Sibelius system texts). The format of such text can be freely edited.
Combine selected texts
Select at least two text items and choose this option. It brings up a dialog showing the result for you to edit, e.g., adding space etc. Sometimes special dynamics are entered this way, e.g.,, "sf-mf", entered as "sf" "-" and "mf", should be combined into one text item. Only items in the same voice, the same part and the same measure can be combined.
Split text
Split current text block into separate ones. A dialog appears, and you can press shift+enter at the position you want to split.
Move text
Move current text to different voice/part. A dialog will let you scroll through the part+voice to re-place the text. When the same beat position is not available due to note/rest value difference, the text will be shifted backwards to the nearest note/rest.
Hyphenation
For long text blocks, hyphenation is required. The options are (English) End of line and (Chinese) Begin of line.

----------------------------------------

2.5 Lyrics Management Dialog
A dialog showing table like Text management. The layout is:
part, lyrics
But since the lyrics are long blocks, they will not be displayed completely here. The beginning 5 words will be shown, and when pressing F2, a dialog containing multiple line editbox will appear for you to edit. In the dialog, there are radio buttons to switch between print and braille mode.

Context menu
Undo/Redo
Common undo/redo function.
Translation table
Listbox. Choose a table for current selected lyrics part.

Chinese lyrics
Checkbox. Chinese lyrics has different format from English one. This will be done later (todo item).

Use lyric sign
Checkbox. Toggle lyric sign (dots 5-6 2-3) on/off. Some countries don't use lyric sign.

Lyrics position
Radio button, put lyric line above/below music.

Use repetition
Checkbox. If same word(s) are repeated, use repeat signs (one or two dots 3-5's and one 3-5 around the block, or number plus dots 3-5 before and dots 3-5 alone after it, when repetition is more than 3 times).

2.6 Chords Management
(to do it later)

----------------------------------------

2.7 Metronome Dialog
This is a list of all metronome marks in the score.

========================================

Chapter 3: Braille Music Editing And Debugging Related Points
This chapter discusses braille music editing and correction related subjects.

3.1 GUI specifications
The working area of BrailleOrch is an edit window like Windows notepad. Items entered and displayed here are all unicode braille. Untranslatable items such as Chinese characters are displayed as yellow question marks, and in braille output, a set of computer-braille question marks (dots 1-4-5-6). Untagged items such as user-entered customized items are marked as "other" in bmml and displayed in gray. BrailleOrch can also ignore non-fatal musicxml errors, and displays such problematic items in red. Very serious error such as unmatched element tags will generate warnings, and store the xml into .bor file for debugging. Once debugging is finished, it can then be transcribed using Transcribe under Transcription Menu.

Items in the edit window must be announced via screen readers such as NVDA. The description should be as brief but clear as possible. Dots should also be announced. Settings of announcing modes are in Options Menu.

----------------------------------------

3.2 Entering And Marking Items
When correcting the music, for example, adding missing signs, moving words' position etc, please press letter n to start entering notes/rests/articulations. BrailleOrch will recognize them automatically. Unfinished enter will be tagged and announced as "other".
(Note: make this complicated function later, now just tag all user-entered strings as "other". So reformatting of individual lines must be done manually, like manual transcription.)
For moving words, please put cursor on any location within the word block, and right-click, choose "Cut", and paste it to new location. BrailleOrch always treats a word block as a single object.

When the cursor is on a part prefix, word block, lyric and chord symbol line, pressing F2 will bring up an edit window for simple modification, without opening corresponding dialogs. You can choose from normal and braille inputs via radio buttons.

Note: After editing a part prefix, a confirmation dialog will appear, asking you whether to change the prefix globaly. This is useful when a part switches to another instrument or ensemble changes to solo. In notation programs, sighted engraver only hides part prefix and uses normal text to make such a change, but in braille, we must use corresponding prefix to make things clear.
Note to BMML developers: In such case, the partlist will generate an extra sub-element to show a different prefix, from and to which measure. Or we can directly insert such tag within the score itself, like temporary midi instrument changes in Musicxml.

Context menu for marking items
Besides common edit context items, here are some special ones:
Tagging
Change the property of current selected braille character(s). Available choices are text-music, text-non-music, text-title, text-subtitle, text-composer, text-lyricist, lyrics, chords, metronome marks, rehearsal marks, articulation and other.
Part/Text/Lyrics/Chords/Metronome management
These are the same dialogs introduced before, but only display selected items on-the-fly. When on a specified item, dialogs of other properties will be grayed.

----------------------------------------

3.3 Debugging Mode
This is a special tool for advanced users or developers to find errors in both Musicxml and BMML. Most of the errors are from incomplete musicxml, or some undeveloped features making BrailleOrch ill. The debugging mode will show errors and let you correct fatal errors on-the-fly.

This mode will generate two extra windows linked to the main braille edit window (ctrl+1), one for Musicxml (ctrl+2) and the other BMML (ctrl+3) respectively. Ctrl+tab and shift+ctrl+tab can also cycle among these windows.

When navigating in one window, the other two will also be updated. For example, when navigated to a new note in braille, the other two will put the cursor to the first line of this entry.

Toolbar:
find error (ctrl+F2)
Liit all errors in a box to choose. The list shows errors layouted as part-measure-voice-beat. Press OK to jump there.
Next error (Ctrl+F5)
Previous error (ctrl+F3)
Ignore (ctrl+)
Mark such item as "other" quickly.

In the two xml windows, you can't do any copy/paste functions, but can still enter and delete, for example, correcting or deleting garbage codes (Finale often exports Chinese as garbage codes), and fix mismatched element entry. This way, copyrighted print materials will not be duplicated by end-users (unless he/she has enough time and patience to re-type thousands or millions of xml lines!).

========================================

Chapter 4: Options Dialog

Ah, we come to the last chapter, wholy dedicated to the most sophisticated part--Options dialog! This is a multipage dialog, with several category pages dealing with almost all problems with braille music transcription. Settings in this dialog will apply globaly to any imported Musicxml files.

4.1 General Page
Default language (listbox)
Current English only. More languages will be added later.

Show transcription dialog after importing (checkbox)
Whether show transcription dialog before processing Musicxml file. If not, the transcription will be done according previously defined settings.

Open debugging dialog when fatal error occurs (checkbox)
When serious xml errors are found, the software will automatically open the debugging mode. You can use find error function to navigate in all 3 windows. In most case, braille window will be empty, so use Transcribe in Transcription menu after correction.

Page setup (button)
Bring up Page setup dialog in File menu.

----------------------------------------

4.2 Transcription Page
Translation table (listbox)
List out all translation tables for literary braille.

Show capital signs (checkbox)
Some countries don't show capital signs. Note that capital signs will always be removed when texts are using word sign prefix (dots 3-4-5).

UK metronome format (checkbox)
Braille music produced in UK uses a different metronome expression. Instead of note-equals-number, it uses a sequence of stem sign, space, UK equal sign (dots 5-6 2-3-5-6) and number.

Signs to be transcribed (button)
A dialog list out some signs. Uncheck some of them when transcribing scores for beginners.
The signs are: clefs, fingerings, articulations, ornaments, lyrics, and chords.

Use doubling (checkbox)
Apply doubling to articulations, bowings, tremolos etc.

Braille repetitions (listbox)
None
Within measure
Within and between measures
All
Use braille repetition signs. All will use measure reference, e.g., 1-8.

Add extra accidentals (checkbox)
For a tied accidental note in a new measure, add an extra accidental preceded by dot 5.

Add extra tie to new system (checkbox)
Some countries have such a custom, to add a reference tie when the tied measure starts at a new system in bar-over-bar/line-over-line formats, or a new section in section-by-section format.

Output interval direction description (checkbox)
See this item in Transcription dialog for details.

Output part list (checkbox)
This will usually generate new braille page(s) before the first music page. The list will show all parts and braille abbrev names listed and edited in the part tables in Part management dialog. 2-cell indentation for long names is automatic. New line can also be entered by pressing shift+enter in braille input mode in Braille part list table.

Output part list option (radio button)
On new page
Just before music
When only keyboard without part name is available, always don't use a new page, just say "keyboard". When an solo line is above the keyboard, then "solo XX (instrument name) with keyboard accompaniment".

----------------------------------------

4.3 Single-line Page
format: continuous, line-based
These two radio buttons adjust format of the music. Some countries format it like section-by-section, according to measure amount of every staff in print version. When set to continuous mode, measure numbers will not be shown.
Section prefix (listbox)
System number only
Show system numbers before every section of music. The format is a parenthesised item with "l"+number with number sign.
Measure numbers only
The same as system number, but with the prefix "b".
System and measure numbers
Combine the above to into parenthesis, separated by a space.

----------------------------------------

4.4 Bar-over-bar Page
This is the default format for multiple staff score.
Measure number format (listbox)
Don't show
Left without number sign (default for piano/organ scores)
Left with number sign
Left with number sign for only first measure of a print system (a format used by ONCE, Spain, for both piano and ensemble scores)
Above the system for the first measure (first measure of the braille system, default for scores more than 2 parts)
Above system for all measures (all measures of the braille system)
Above with measure range (for example, 48-49)
Show system number (checkbox)
This will put a number (without number sign) before left hand sign (no space) of keyboard music, or put a parenthesized "l"+number item centered above measure number in ensemble score.
Rehearsal mark placement (listbox)
After part prefix
Before part prefix
Above music and measure number
Above music and at the same line of measure number
When the last choice is set, Above system for all measures must be turned to first measure in case of unsufficient room in the line. 
Add tracking dots (checkbox)
When a line contains 7 and more spaces, tracking dots (dot 3) are added to ease navigation. Some countries don't use them.
Multi-piano format (listbox)
Piano style
Chamber style
When transcribing a multi-piano score, there are two different formats. Piano style is to add a lower-celled number after dots 3-4-5 of hand signs; chamber style will use the style like orchestral music, showing part prefixes.
Use parallel motion
Use parallel motion sign for doubled parts in an ensemble score.
Ensemble score cutoff (listbox)
No
Yes according to print
Yes for all silent instruments
This is not applied to keyboard and solo with keyboard accompaniment scores. No will display all staves all the time, Yes according to print will hide silent staves according to settings in Musicxml, and Yes for all silent instruments will hide all silented (rest-only) instruments. If all instruments stop for one or more measures, staves of previously playing ones are shown.
Show all parts on first page (checkbox)
Display full part names on first page (checkbox)
These two are for ensemble scores.
Key signature placement (radio buttons)
Before part prefix
After part prefix
For scores with parts in different keys, or with transposing instruments with different key signatures. When at the left, all other part names must be shifted right. For scores with the same key in all parts, key signature will be automatically brailled above system, below measure numbers.
Key signature display (listbox)
All the time
Only once (appear at the beginning of part. If Show all parts on first page is checked, they are present there. If not, they will appear at the places where the paqts appear for the first time.)
Reappear after silence
The same as the second one, but will reappear after the instrument staves' cutoff.
Time signature placement (radio button)
After part prefixes
Above system
Two circumstances will override this setting, and print time signatures always within every part: 1. Different part has different time signature; 2. Time signature changes in the middle of a braille system.
Place blank line between keyboard systems (checkbox)
Sometimes for easy reading purpose, keyboard and solo with keyboard accompaniment scores are formatted by separating systems using blank line.
Place blank line between ensemble systems (checkbox)
Most of the ensemble scores using this custom.
Ignore page turnning (checkbox)
The first part of a parallel will not be forced to put in a new page. This is for l9ng orchestral music to save paper.
Ignore new system (checkbox)
By default, both bar-over-bar and line-over-line will start a new parallel when Musicxml starts a new system. Checking this will prevent BrailleOrch from starting a new parallel if there's room for the following measure(s) on next system. In this case, new system number will be moved to the next parallel in keyboard score, while shown above system right at the beginning of new system in ensemble score. If page turn is met, the turning page sign will be brailled at its right place.

----------------------------------------

4.5 Line-over-line Page
The main difference of these two formats is whether to vertically align measures in all staves of the system. In line-over-line, all measures in a system are not aligned, and once there's a staff which doesn't come to line break, other staves can continue with several lines of music. The advantage of line-over-line is saving paper.
Most of the settings of bar-over-bar are the same, except the following:
Measure number format: no Above system for all measures
No Add tracking dots
Ignore new system will turn off system number completely.

----------------------------------------

4.6 Section-by-section Page
Section-by-section is used in many countries with varied layouts. Here, I choose some classical features for the users. If anyone who wants a different layout, please contact Daniel Barich for implementation.

Indentation (radio button)
First line indent
Following lines indent
These are two main different indentation styles.
Line-over-line style (checkbox)
Only applicable to keyboard music. The layout is much like line-over-line, but line breaking is free for all staves.
Measure number placement for line-over-line style (radio button)
Left of music
Above system
Section head format (radio button)
Section only (section number)
Measure only (measure number)
Section and measure (plus number of first measure, no space and number sign. See next control)
Section and measure range (section number, space, measure range)
These are 4 classical head styles of a section.
Section and measure number format (radio button)
Section uper-celled
Measure upper-celled
These two numbers are often in different type, one upper-celled while the other lower-celled.
Use system number as section number (checkbox)
It uses system number on a print page for section number. So if a new page is here, the section number will return to 1.
Place blank line between sections (checkbox)
See previous explanation.
Key signature placement: no Before part prefix
Other options of key and time signatures are the same as previous two formats.
Braille page turn is ignored, but print system change can't. This ensures the sections to sync to systems in print.
Other options are nearly the same as line-over-line.
