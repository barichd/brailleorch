<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	A direction is a musical indication that is not attached
	to a specific note. Two or more may be combined to
	indicate starts and stops of wedges, dashes, etc.

	By default, a series of direction-type elements and a 
	series of child elements of a direction-type within a 
	single direction element follow one another in sequence
	visually. For a series of direction-type children, non-
	positional formatting attributes are carried over from
	the previous element by default.

	Metronome marks and other metric relationships.
	
	The beat-unit values are the same as for a type element,
	and the beat-unit-dot works like the dot element. The
	per-minute element can be a number, or a text description
	including numbers. The parentheses attribute indicates
	whether or not to put the metronome mark in parentheses;
	its value is no if not specified. If a font is specified for
	the per-minute element, it overrides the font specified for
	the overall metronome element. This allows separate
	specification of a music font for beat-unit and a text
	font for the numeric value in cases where a single
	metronome font is not used.

	The metronome-note and metronome-relation elements
	allow for the specification of more complicated metric
	relationships, such as swing tempo marks where 
	two eighths are equated to a quarter note / eighth note
	triplet. The metronome-type, metronome-beam, and
	metronome-dot elements work like the type, beam, and
	dot elements. The metronome-tuplet element uses the
	same element structure as the time-modification element
	along with some attributes from the tuplet element. The
	metronome-relation element describes the relationship
	symbol that goes between the two sets of metronome-note
	elements. The currently allowed value is equals, but this
	may expand in future versions. If the element is empty,
	the equals value is used. The metronome-relation and
	the following set of metronome-note elements are optional
	to allow display of an isolated Grundschlagnote.

<!-- Harmony -->

<!--
	The harmony elements are based on Humdrum's **harm
	encoding, extended to support chord symbols in popular
	music as well as functional harmony analysis in classical
	music.
	
	If there are alternate harmonies possible, this can be
	specified using multiple harmony elements differentiated
	by type. Explicit harmonies have all note present in the
	music; implied have some notes missing but implied;
	alternate represents alternate analyses. 
	
	The harmony object may be used for analysis or for
	chord symbols. The print-object attribute controls
	whether or not anything is printed due to the harmony
	element. The print-frame attribute controls printing
	of a frame or fretboard diagram. The print-style entity
	sets the default for the harmony, but individual elements
	can override this with their own print-style values.
	
	A harmony element can contain many stacked chords (e.g.
	V of II). A sequence of harmony-chord entities is used
	for this type of secondary function, where V of II would
	be represented by a harmony-chord with a V function
	followed by a harmony-chord with a II function.

	A root is a pitch name like C, D, E, where a function
	is an indication like I, II, III. Root is generally
	used with pop chord symbols, function with classical
	functional harmony. It is an either/or choice to avoid
	data inconsistency. Function requires that the key be
	specified in the encoding. 

	The root element has a root-step and optional root-alter 
	similar to the step and alter elements in a pitch, but
	renamed to distinguish the different musical meanings.
	The root-step text element indicates how the root should
	appear on the page if not using the element contents.
	In some chord styles, this will include the root-alter
	information as well. In that case, the print-object
	attribute of the root-alter element can be set to no.
	The root-alter location attribute indicates whether
	the alteration should appear to the left or the right
	of the root-step; it is right by default.

	Kind indicates the type of chord. Degree elements
	can then add, subtract, or alter from these

	    French
	    German
	Other:
	    pedal (pedal-point bass)
	    power (perfect fifth)
	    Tristan
	
	The "other" kind is used when the harmony is entirely
	composed of add elements. The "none" kind is used to
	explicitly encode absence of chords or functional
	harmony.

	The attributes are used to indicate the formatting
	of the symbol. Since the kind element is the constant
	in all the harmony-chord entities that can make up
	a polychord, many formatting attributes are here.

	The use-symbols attribute is yes if the kind should be
	represented when possible with harmony symbols rather
	than letters and numbers. These symbols include:

	    major: a triangle, like Unicode 25B3
	    minor: -, like Unicode 002D
	    augmented: +, like Unicode 002B
	    diminished: °, like Unicode 00B0
	    half-diminished: ø, like Unicode 00F8

	The text attribute describes how the kind should be 
	spelled if not using symbols; it is ignored if use-symbols
	is yes. The stack-degrees attribute is yes if the degree 
	elements should be stacked above each other. The 
	parentheses-degrees attribute is yes if all the degrees 
	should be in parentheses. The bracket-degrees attribute
	is yes if all the degrees should be in a bracket. If not 
	specified, these values are implementation-specific.
	The alignment attributes are for the entire harmony-chord
	entity of which this kind element is a part.

	The degree element is used to add, alter, or subtract
	individual notes in the chord. The degree-value element
	is a number indicating the degree of the chord (1 for
	the root, 3 for third, etc). The degree-alter element
	is like the alter element in notes: 1 for sharp, -1 for
	flat, etc. The degree-type element can be add, alter, or
	subtract. If the degree-type is alter or subtract, the
	degree-alter is relative to the degree already in the
	chord based on its kind element. If the degree-type is
	add, the degree-alter is relative to a dominant chord
	(major and perfect intervals except for a minor 
	seventh). The print-object attribute can be used to

	the kind element. The plus-minus attribute is used to
	indicate if plus and minus symbols should be used
	instead of sharp and flat symbols to display the degree
	alteration; it is no by default. The degree-value and
	degree-type text attributes specify how the value and

	to change how a part name or abbreviation is displayed over
	the course of a piece. They take effect when the current
	measure or a succeeding measure starts a new system.
	
	The new-system and new-page attributes indicate whether
	to force a system or page break, or to force the current
	music onto the same system or page as the preceding music.
	Normally this is the first music data within a measure.
	If used in multi-part music, they should be placed in the
	same positions within each part, or the results are
	undefined. The page-number attribute sets the number of a
	new page; it is ignored if new-page is not "yes". Version
	2.0 adds a blank-page attribute. This is a positive integer
	value that specifies the number of blank pages to insert
	before the current measure. It is ignored if new-page is
	not "yes". These blank pages have no music, but may have

	Staff spacing between multiple staves is measured in
	tenths of staff lines (e.g. 100 = 10 staff lines). This is

	Layout elements in a print statement only apply to the
	current page, system, staff, or measure. Music that

	layout included in the defaults element.

	The measure-numbering element describes how measure
	numbers are displayed on this part. Values may be none,
	measure, or system. The number attribute from the measure
	element is used for printing. Measures with an implicit
	attribute set to "yes" never display a measure number,
	regardless of the measure-numbering setting.

<!-- 
	The sound element contains general playback parameters.
	They can stand alone within a part/measure, or be a
	component element within a direction.
	
	Tempo is expressed in quarter notes per minute. If 0,
	the sound-generating program should prompt the user at the
	time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.
	
	Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage
	of the default forte value (90 for MIDI 1.0).
	
	Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
	movement. When used it always has the value "yes".
	
	Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a
	segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps
	to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
	of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
	them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
	can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
	per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
	programs may have to recompute this.
	
	By default, a dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that
	the jump should occur the first time through, while a 
	tocoda attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
	time through. The time that jumps occur can be changed by
	using the time-only attribute.
	
	Forward-repeat is used when a forward repeat sign is
	implied, and usually follows a bar line. When used it
	always has the value of "yes".
	
	The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a
	movement with a da capo or dal segno direction. If numeric,
	the value represents the actual duration of the final note or
	rest, which can be ambiguous in written notation and 
	different among parts and voices. The value may also be 
	"yes" to indicate no change to the final duration.
	
	If the sound element applies only one time through a
	repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which time
	to apply the sound element.
	
	Pizzicato in a sound element effects all following notes.
	Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.

	The pan and elevation attributes are deprecated in 
	Version 2.0. The pan and elevation elements in
	the midi-instrument element should be used instead.
	The meaning of the pan and elevation attributes is
	the same as for the pan and elevation elements. If
	both are present, the mid-instrument elements take
	priority.
	
	The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal 
	attributes effect playback of the three common piano
	pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. The yes
	value indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates 
	the pedal is released. A numeric value from 0 to 100
	may also be used for half pedaling. This value is the
	percentage that the pedal is depressed. A value of 0 is
	equivalent to no, and a value of 100 is equivalent to yes.
	
	MIDI instruments are changed using the midi-instrument
	element defined in the common.mod file.

	The offset element is used to indicate that the sound takes
	place offset from the current score position. If the sound
	element is a child of a direction element, the sound offset
	element overrides the direction offset element if both 
	elements are present. Note that the offset reflects the
	intended musical position for the change in sound. It
	should not be used to compensate for latency issues in 
	particular hardware configurations.
