<!--
	Starting with Version 2.0, the MusicXML format includes a
	standard zip compressed version. These zip files can contain
	multiple MusicXML files as well as other media files for
	images and sound. The container DTD describes the contents
	of the META-INF/container.xml file. The container describes
	the starting point for the MusicXML version of the file, as
	well as alternate renditions such as PDF and audio versions
	of the musical score.

	The MusicXML zip file format is compatible with the zip format
	used by the java.util.zip package and Java JAR files. It is 
	based on the Info-ZIP format described at:

	ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/doc/appnote-970311-iz.zip

	The JAR file format is specified at:

	http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html

	Note that, compatible with JAR files, file names should be
	encoded in UTF-8 format. 

	Files with the zip container are compressed the DEFLATE 
	algorithm. The DEFLATE Compressed Data Format (RFC 1951)
	is specified at:

	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt

	The recommended file suffix for compressed MusicXML files
	is .mxl. The recommended media type for a compressed
	MusicXML file is:

		application/vnd.recordare.musicxml

	The recommended media type for an uncompressed MusicXML
	file is:

		application/vnd.recordare.musicxml+xml

	Suggested use:

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Container is the document element.
-->
<!ELEMENT container (rootfiles)>

<!--
	Rootfiles include the starting points for the different
	representations of a MusicXML score. The MusicXML root
	must be described in the first rootfile element. Additional
	rootfile elements can describe alternate versions such as
	PDF and audio files.
-->
<!ELEMENT rootfiles (rootfile+)>

<!--
	The rootfile element describes each top-level file in
	the MusicXML container. The full-path attribute provides
	the path relative to the root folder of the zip file. The
	media-type identifies the type of different top-level
	root files. It is an error to have a non-MusicXML
	media-type value in the first rootfile in a rootfiles
	element. If no media-type value is present, a MusicXML
	file is assumed. A MusicXML file used as a rootfile may
	have score-partwise, score-timewise, or opus as its
	document element.
